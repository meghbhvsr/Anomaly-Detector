Anomaly Detection and Visualization Algorithm
 - Used the Isolation Forest Algorithm
 - Sliding Window, to look at 50 data points at a time, no more and no less,
 - Checks if the 50th data point is an outlier, outliers show up as red
 - Removed data from the start, as new points are added
 - Visualizes the data using a graph
